There is a new major release out with some new features: Thanks to @SadieCat there
has been a number of new IRCv3 features and also strikethrough formatting support. Thanks
to @BakasuraRCE the flishlim plugin got a lot of love and now supports CBC mode. And fans
of Python scripts should be happy with a drastic reduction in memory usage with multiple scripts.

This release also comes with some bad news; The HexChat project has been undermaintained for quite
a while now. I've been involved with this project since I was a high school student but that
is long past and I simply don't have the time to dedicate to it any longer. The Windows builds
in particular are very draining and in a poor state which has kept smaller releases from happening
more frequently. If anybody out there doesn't mind building things on Windows or wants to help with
maintainance contact @TingPing on Libera.Chat.
